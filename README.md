# USP:
* `Dstream` will enable you to list your videos as NFT's in `Dstreams's Ecosystem`.
* `Content creators` can opt to list their videos in a marketplace where other people can `buy` their `content along with the monetization benefits` for that content post the time of the sale contract.
* Option to create a closed group of NFT based premium content community `(Token Gated Community)`, where they can share or livestream.
* Ad based revenue for consumers for their viewtime/adlength ratio.
* Users in a peer group of different demographic regions can take up the role of content moderators of the platform, and the decisions made on reports of a platform are passed over by a consensus mechanism, based on the number of moderations the user can get rewards for the same.

# Progress So Far:
* Created our `Own Token DST` and deployed in [`Polygon Mumbai Testnet`](!https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x548ADCAf24F9b71d749b11BAdC4749ad070Dd771)

* Interface the Token benefits for users and content creators within DSTREAM.
* Created a [`PYPI package for Livepeer in Python`](https://pypi.org/project/LivePeerSDK/)
